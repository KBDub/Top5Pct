                    <p class="text-charcoal-light mb-3">Before you can find the perfect custom t-shirt maker, you need to know what you want. Create a checklist to help you decide what you need. Be as specific as possible so you can determine what requirements you need from the printing company. The list should include different factors, including:</p>

                </x-ui.card-faq>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="2. How Many T-Shirts Do You Need">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light">Considering the number of t-shirts you need seems like an easy task, but considering the number of shirts you need involves more than you may realize. Are these custom shirts only for your employees to wear while at work or during company events? Are you purchasing these shirts to include them in a promotional giveaway or other special bonus? Are you hosting a family reunion? Keep in mind most printing companies offer custom print jobs in bulk quantities. Make sure the company you choose offers a variety of printing options. The more printing options that are available, the more likely the company can meet your needs.</p>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="3. Designs and Graphics">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light">Graphics and designs are essential when it comes to custom t-shirts. It is no secret that printing certain logos, photographs, and designs can be difficult, so you need to make sure the printing company you choose is capable of completing the job. Ask to view samples of their work to determine if the company is a good fit.</p>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="4. Turnaround Time">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light">Time is a crucial factor when printing custom t-shirts. Do not wait until the last minute to find a shirt printing company. Many custom shirt printing companies require a minimum number of days to complete your order, so a 24 to 72-hour turnaround time may be unrealistic. Always check the company's lead times.</p>
                </x-ui.card-faq>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="5. Pricing">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light">You need to speak about pricing upfront, including refunds and similar terms. "You get what you pay for" is a phrase that is true in this situation. The least expensive rate is not always going to be the best option. In retrospect, the most expensive option does not mean the products and services are professional. Find a custom printing company that has a balance of reasonable pricing and quality.</p>
                </x-ui.card-faq>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="6. Customer Service">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light">Customer service is a part of your overall experience with a company. A remarkable custom printing company will be helpful, whether online, over the phone, or through a support form. The company should be willing to help you through every aspect of the buying process.</p>
                </x-ui.card-faq>

                <x-ui.card-faq question="7. Rates and Reviews">
                    <p class="text-charcoal-light mb-3">Rates and reviews are essential when you are looking for a custom t-shirt company. Reading the rates and reviews gives you insight into the company and how they conduct business. Read at least 10 reviews for the company, whether they are positive or negative. Positive and negative reviews help you determine which custom printing company will best suit your needs.</p>

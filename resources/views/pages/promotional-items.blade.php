        <p class="mb-4">Promotional products are one of the oldest and most effective forms of business marketing because they create a physical, lasting connection between your brand and the people who receive them. Unlike digital ads that disappear the moment you stop paying for them, a branded mug or koozie stays on someone's desk or in their kitchen for years. Every time they use it, they see your name. Every time a guest notices it, your brand gets an impression. <a href="/" class="link-notification">Top 5 Percent</a> helps businesses throughout Joliet, Shorewood, Plainfield, and Will and DuPage County create branded promotional products that deliver long-term value for a fraction of the cost of other advertising channels.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We offer a curated selection of high-quality promotional products that people actually use, mugs for the office, koozies for the game, towels for the gym, coasters for the restaurant table, tote bags for the grocery run, and mouse pads for the desk. Every item is printed with your full-color logo or custom design using dye sublimation, which bonds the ink into the material so it stays sharp and vibrant through years of daily use. We work with businesses, nonprofits, sports organizations, schools, and event coordinators throughout Will and DuPage County who need branded products that make a great impression.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Combine promotional products with <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel</a> for a complete branded event package, shirts and hoodies alongside mugs, koozies, and tote bags, all printed with your logo and ready for the same event or campaign.</p>
        <p>No minimums on any promotional product, order exactly what you need. Call us at <a href="tel:+18153498600" class="link-notification">(815) 349-8600</a> or stop by 121 Springfield Avenue in Joliet to discuss your promotional product order today.</p>

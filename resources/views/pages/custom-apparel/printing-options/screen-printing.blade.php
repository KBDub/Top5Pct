        title="The Classic Standard for Custom Apparel"
    >
        <p class="mb-4">Screen printing is the most time-tested method for decorating custom apparel, and the backbone of our <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel</a> shop in Joliet. The process pushes thick, opaque ink directly through a mesh screen onto the fabric, building up a solid color layer that sits on the surface with a tactile presence you can feel with your fingertip. The result is a bold, high-contrast print that holds up through years of washing without fading, cracking, or peeling. For bulk <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/corporate-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">corporate wear</a> orders with simple designs and quantities of twelve or more, screen printing is typically the most cost-effective production method available.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Screen printing works on virtually any fabric type, including cotton, polyester, blends, and performance fabrics. It is the standard method for <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/corporate-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">company uniforms</a>, team apparel, band merchandise, and organization gear across Joliet and throughout Will and DuPage County. When you need matching shirts for a large group and you want them to look consistent, clean, and durable, screen printing is the right call.</p>
        <p><a href="/" class="link-notification">Top 5 Percent</a> produces screen printed apparel for businesses, schools, churches, and community organizations throughout the Chicagoland area, including popular <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/spirit-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">spirit wear</a> orders for local schools and sports leagues. For full-color photographic designs or small runs without setup fees, see our <a href="/custom-apparel/printing-options/dtf-printing" class="link-notification">DTF transfers</a>. Call us at <a href="tel:+18153498600" class="link-notification">(815) 349-8600</a> or visit 121 Springfield Avenue in Joliet to talk about your screen printing project today.</p>

    >
        <p class="mb-4">Screen printing becomes increasingly cost-effective as quantities increase because the setup costs are spread across a larger number of units. This makes it the preferred method for large group orders like company uniforms and <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/spirit-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">school spirit wear</a> where consistent colors across many shirts matter most. If you need fifty or more <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/reunion-shirts" class="link-notification">reunion shirts</a> or team jerseys, screen printing will give you the best combination of print quality, durability, and cost per unit of any decorating method available.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We handle everything from single-color text prints to multi-color graphic designs with detailed artwork. Each color in your design requires its own screen, so designs with two to four colors represent the sweet spot for screen printing in terms of cost and visual impact. For designs with a specialty raised surface, our <a href="/custom-apparel/specialty-materials/puff-shirts" class="link-notification">puff print shirts</a> are a bold complement to a screen-printed base design.</p>
        <p>Our team reviews every screen printing order before production begins to make sure your artwork is set up correctly for the print process. We want every shirt we send out to meet our quality standard and yours. Call us at <a href="tel:+18153498600" class="link-notification">(815) 349-8600</a> to get a quote on your custom screen printing order today.</p>

        <x-slot name="intro">
            <p class="mb-4">Screen printing has been the gold standard for custom apparel decoration for decades, and it remains the top choice for large group orders at our <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel shop</a> in Joliet. No other method consistently delivers the combination of bold color vibrancy, long-term durability, and cost efficiency that screen printing provides for group orders. When you need fifty or more matching shirts that look great on day one and still look great years later, screen printing is the right method, and we have the equipment, expertise, and commitment to quality to prove it.</p>
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">1. Unmatched Color Vibrancy and Opacity</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Screen printing uses plastisol inks that sit on top of the fabric rather than soaking into it, which produces colors that are significantly more opaque and vibrant than digital printing methods. White ink on a dark shirt, for example, is a known challenge for digital printers but comes out crisp and bright every time with screen printing. Bold logos, strong typographic designs, and high-contrast graphics all look their absolute best when screen printed. For designs that require photographic gradients or full-color imagery, see our <a href="/custom-apparel/printing-options/dtf-printing" class="link-notification">DTF transfers</a> or <a href="/custom-apparel/printing-options/dye-sublimation-printing" class="link-notification">dye sublimation</a> options.</p>
        </x-slot>
        <x-slot name="mid">
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">2. Exceptional Durability</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Plastisol screen printing inks are cured with heat during production, creating a bond with the fabric that holds up through years of washing. A properly screen-printed shirt from our <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel shop</a> will maintain its graphic through dozens or even hundreds of washes without significant fading, cracking, or peeling. This durability makes screen printing ideal for uniforms and team gear. For maximum durability in professional settings, <a href="/custom-apparel/printing-options/embroidery" class="link-notification">embroidery</a> stitches your logo directly into the fabric for a finish that outlasts any print method.</p>
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">3. Best Cost Per Unit for Larger Quantities</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">While screen printing has setup costs, those costs are spread across the full order quantity so the more shirts you order, the lower the cost per unit. For orders of twenty-four or more shirts, screen printing is consistently the most cost-effective decorating method, especially when ordering <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/corporate-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">corporate wear</a> or team gear in bulk.</p>
        </x-slot>
        <x-slot name="lower">
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">4. Works on Almost Any Garment</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Screen printing works on cotton, cotton blends, polyester, and most other common apparel materials. T-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, polos, <a href="/promotional-items/tote-bags" class="link-notification">tote bags</a>, and hats are all fair game. The versatility of screen printing across garment types makes it the logical choice when you need a consistent look across a mixed order of <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/reunion-shirts" class="link-notification">reunion shirts</a>, team wear, and accessories.</p>

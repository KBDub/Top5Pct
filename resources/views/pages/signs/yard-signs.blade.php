            <p class="mb-4">We help businesses across Joliet, Will and DuPage County use yard signs to attract new customers every day. A well placed yard sign near a busy road can reach hundreds of people without any ongoing cost, and many of our clients pair them with <a href="/signs/business-signs/banners" class="link-notification">custom banners</a> for complete outdoor coverage during grand openings and seasonal promotions. Whether you run a restaurant, a home service company, or a retail store, yard signs are one of the most cost effective ways to promote your brand in the community, and for storefronts our <a href="/signs/business-signs/window-signs" class="link-notification">window signs</a> keep your brand visible from inside and out at the same time.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We keep the process simple. You can bring your own design or use our free online designer to build one from scratch, and our <a href="/design-services/logo-design" class="link-notification">logo design</a> team has years of experience creating eye catching yard sign layouts that are easy to read from a distance. Bold colors, clean fonts, and a clear call to action are what make a yard sign work.</p>

        >
            <p class="mb-4">We print on corrugated plastic because it is the best material for the price. Corrugated plastic is lightweight but strong. It does not crack or warp in cold weather and it resists moisture so your design stays looking sharp through rain and shine. We can print on one side or both sides depending on how you plan to use the sign. Optional metal H stakes make it easy to push your sign right into the ground with no tools required. If you need something heavier and more permanent, we can also print on aluminum for a sign that will last for many years outdoors.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Corrugated plastic signs are also great for indoor use. We frequently print table top signs for wedding receptions, trade shows, open houses, and corporate events in Joliet and throughout the Chicagoland area. A table sign with your logo and your name printed in full color adds a professional touch to any display or event table. We have helped couples create custom wedding table signs that double as keepsakes and we have helped real estate brokers create branded table displays for open houses in Plainfield, Shorewood, and Romeoville.</p>
            <p>Whatever you need your sign for, we have the right material and the right print to get the job done. Pair corrugated table signs with branded <a href="/signs/table-signs/table-runners" class="link-notification">table runners</a> for a fully dressed event table. We work with customers from all over Will and DuPage County and the Chicagoland region and we are always happy to walk you through your options. Call us at <a href="tel:+18153498600" class="link-notification">(815) 349-8600</a> or stop by our shop at 121 Springfield Avenue in Joliet to talk about your next sign project.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Yard signs are one of the most direct and affordable ways to get your message in front of local customers in Joliet, Plainfield, Shorewood, Romeoville, and throughout the greater Chicagoland area. A well placed yard sign on a busy corner or in front of a property where work is being done can generate dozens of new inquiries without any ongoing cost once the sign is in the ground. We print custom yard signs for businesses, real estate agents, political campaigns, contractors, event organizers, and community groups all across Will and DuPage County, and many of those clients also order matching <a href="/signs/business-signs/banners" class="link-notification">banners</a> to anchor their event signage package. Here is how to get the most out of your yard sign investment.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Placement Strategy Makes All the Difference</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Where you put your sign matters just as much as what it says. The goal is to place your yard signs where as many relevant eyes as possible will see them. High traffic intersections, busy residential streets near your service area, and the properties where you are actively working are all prime locations. A contractor in Joliet who places a yard sign at every job site throughout Shorewood, Crest Hill, and Plainfield is essentially turning each project into a billboard for future work in that neighborhood. Real estate agents who plant signs at busy corners throughout their farm area create a feeling of familiarity that builds name recognition over time and keeps their name top of mind when a neighbor is ready to buy or sell.</p>

                <x-slot name="mid">
                    <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Design Your Sign to Be Read at Speed</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Yard signs need to be readable by someone driving past at 25 to 35 miles per hour. That means short messages, big text, and strong contrast, which is why many clients also invest in matching <a href="/signs/business-signs/banners" class="link-notification">banners</a> that carry the same bold typography at a larger scale for maximum visibility. Your most important information needs to be readable at a quick glance from the road, and our <a href="/design-services/logo-design" class="link-notification">design team</a> knows how to lay out a sign that communicates quickly and clearly without feeling cluttered or difficult to process in the short window of time a passing driver has to absorb the message.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Use Cases Across Many Industries</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Yard signs serve businesses in almost every industry across the Chicagoland area. Contractors, landscapers, and home service providers use them to generate referrals in the neighborhoods where they are actively working, and they often pair yard signs with <a href="/vehicle-graphics" class="link-notification">vehicle graphics</a> to create a cohesive brand presence across every job site. Real estate agents use them to advertise listings and open houses throughout Will and DuPage County, and political candidates use them to build name recognition, with many also ordering branded <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/spirit-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">spirit wear</a> for their volunteer teams.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Whatever your industry, there is a way to put a yard sign to work for your business. We have printed yard signs for clients in virtually every category and we are always happy to share ideas for maximizing impact, including pairing with <a href="/signs/business-signs/window-signs" class="link-notification">window signs</a> for businesses that want consistent branding at every touchpoint.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">We print corrugated plastic yard signs in full color using UV resistant inks that hold up through Illinois weather without fading or peeling. We offer single sided and double sided printing, optional metal H-stakes for easy installation, and bulk pricing that rewards larger orders, and clients who need a complete outdoor package can add <a href="/signs/business-signs/banners" class="link-notification">vinyl banners</a> to their yard sign order for a coordinated street presence. Same day printing is available on select sizes so even last minute campaigns can be covered, and for event-day branding our <a href="/custom-apparel/printing-options/dtf-printing" class="link-notification">DTF transfer shirts</a> are available same-day as well.</p>

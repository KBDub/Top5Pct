        <p class="mb-4">Good graphic design is the bridge between your idea and a finished print product that looks exactly the way you imagined it. Our design team prepares layouts for signs, banners, <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">apparel</a>, promotional products, and any other print application with production quality built in from the start, and unlike working with a designer who is separate from your print vendor our team handles both the artwork and the production so the file goes directly into the press without a translation step. We understand the technical requirements of every product we produce, correct bleed settings, color profiles, resolution requirements, and material-specific design constraints, so your files never get stuck at prepress and your <a href="/signs" class="link-notification">finished signs</a>, shirts, and banners look sharp and accurate every time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We work with customers who have an existing concept they need laid out professionally, customers who have rough sketch ideas they want turned into polished artwork, and customers who need us to create something from scratch based on a conversation about their brand and goals. No matter where you are starting from, we can take you from concept to print-ready file efficiently and without the back-and-forth that comes from working with a designer who does not understand print production, and if your project starts from scratch with no logo our <a href="/design-services/logo-design" class="link-notification">logo design</a> team creates the foundational mark before we begin any layout work.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Need a brand identity before we can build your layout? Our <a href="/design-services/logo-design" class="link-notification">logo design</a> service creates your mark from scratch. From there, we design for every product category we produce. Need a layout for a <a href="/signs/business-signs/banners" class="link-notification">banner</a> or a <a href="/signs/business-signs/posters" class="link-notification">poster</a>? Artwork for a <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel</a> run? A die-cut path for a batch of <a href="/stickers/custom-shaped-stickers-decals" class="link-notification">custom shaped stickers</a>? We handle all of it in-house so the design and the print come from the same team.</p>
        <p>Because <a href="/" class="link-notification">Top 5 Percent</a> both designs and produces your print products in-house, there is no translation layer between your designer and your printer. What you see on screen is what you get off the press. Call us at <a href="tel:+18153498600" class="link-notification">(815) 349-8600</a> to discuss your design project today.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Our graphic design services cover every product we produce. We can design custom shirt graphics, banner and sign layouts, <a href="/stickers/custom-shaped-stickers-decals" class="link-notification">sticker and decal artwork</a>, promotional product designs, trade show display graphics, event programs, and anything else you need to look great in print, and for clients who need vehicle graphics designed alongside their sign and apparel artwork our <a href="/vehicle-graphics" class="link-notification">vehicle graphics</a> shop is part of the same production team. We use industry-standard design software and deliver files in every format required for production, whether that means vector files for vinyl cutting, high-resolution rasters for large-format printing, or embroidery-ready DST files for machine stitching.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We specialize in working with businesses that need design support for ongoing marketing and branding needs. If you run a business in Joliet or Will and DuPage County and you regularly need new shirts, signs, or promotional materials, we can serve as your design resource and production partner. Many of our long-term clients send us their new product or event ideas and trust us to design and produce everything from a single consistent source, and for businesses that want their team to be able to self-serve their orders our <a href="/design-services/custom-storefronts" class="link-notification">custom storefronts</a> give employees or members a branded online store to shop from at any time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">From there, we roll your new logo directly into any print product you need, <a href="/promotional-items" class="link-notification">promotional items</a>, <a href="/vehicle-graphics" class="link-notification">vehicle graphics</a>, and more, all from one team. And a finished design package positions you perfectly to open a <a href="/design-services/custom-storefronts" class="link-notification">custom storefront</a> where your school, team, or organization can place orders at any time without involving your staff.</p>
        <p>We are a veteran owned print and design shop located at 121 Springfield Avenue in Joliet, Illinois. We take pride in the quality and accuracy of everything we design and produce.

        heading="How Working With a Print-Focused Designer Saves You Time, Money, and Frustration"
        image1="/images/business-signs/top5pct-banner-business-signs-joliet-plainfield-shorewood.jpg"
        alt1="Print-ready graphic design services for signs, apparel, and promotional products in Joliet Illinois"
    >
        <x-slot name="intro">
            <p class="mb-4">Most graphic designers are trained for digital or marketing applications, websites, social media graphics, presentations, and digital ads. Print production is a different discipline with specific technical requirements that many generalist designers do not fully understand. When you work with a designer who does not understand print production, you end up with files that need extensive prepress correction, artwork that does not translate correctly from screen to physical product, and a frustrating back-and-forth process that costs you time and often money in reprints. Working with our team eliminates these problems entirely, and because we also produce everything in-house our <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel</a>, signs, and promotional products come out exactly as designed without any translation layer between designer and printer.</p>
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Correct File Setup From the Start</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Every print application has specific file requirements, resolution specifications, color mode settings, bleed dimensions, cut lines, and format requirements that vary by product and production method. Our designers build every file to the exact specifications of the product being produced. Banner files are set up for banner printing. Vinyl cut files are set up for vector cutting. Sublimation files are set up for heat transfer production. This means your files go directly into production without correction delays, saving time at every stage of the process.</p>
        </x-slot>
        <x-slot name="mid">
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Color Accuracy Across Every Product</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">One of the most common frustrations in working with print vendors who are separate from your designer is color inconsistency. The colors on your designer's screen look different from what the printer produces because the two parties are working with different color management systems and expectations. When we design and produce your print products in the same shop, we control the entire color workflow from concept to finished product, and that consistency carries across everything from your <a href="/custom-apparel" class="link-notification">custom apparel</a> to your <a href="/signs" class="link-notification">business signs</a> so your brand colors stay accurate on every substrate. We know exactly how our equipment reproduces specific color values, and we design with that knowledge built in from the beginning.</p>
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">Production Constraints Considered in the Design</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Different print products have different design constraints that experienced designers accommodate naturally. Embroidery cannot reproduce very small text or highly detailed gradients. Vinyl cutting requires a minimum line weight to cut cleanly. Screen printing is limited by the number of spot colors and minimum detail sizes. Dye sublimation works only on polyester. Our designers know these constraints and incorporate them into the design process, ensuring that what we design can actually be produced at the quality level your brand deserves, and for clients who need their logo built or rebuilt before production begins our <a href="/design-services/logo-design" class="link-notification">logo design</a> team creates clean vector artwork that works correctly across every print method from day one.</p>
        </x-slot>
        <x-slot name="lower">
            <h3 class="text-h3 font-bold text-charcoal mb-2">A Long-Term Design Partner for Your Business</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Many of our clients return to us repeatedly for new design work because having a single trusted design and production partner simplifies their entire marketing material workflow. We maintain your brand files, understand your design standards, and can produce new variations quickly without starting from scratch every time, and for businesses that want to take that one step further our <a href="/design-services/custom-storefronts" class="link-notification">custom storefronts</a> give your team or community a fully branded online shop to order from at any time without involving your staff. For businesses that regularly need new event <a href="/custom-apparel/group-wear/spirit-wear-shirts" class="link-notification">spirit wear</a>, updated banner designs, or seasonal promotional materials, this ongoing relationship saves significant time and ensures consistent quality across everything your brand produces.</p>
